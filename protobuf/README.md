# Standard self contained signal encoding format for CC1101 using protobuf

I tried to reverse engineer the proto.xml from URH, probably overkill. Please send PR

Objectives:

* Must have defaults for all configurable settings for transmission using CC1101
* Must include demodulation information/rate/delays and whatever in simple format
* Must use Proto Best Practices and style standards as per ProtoV3

* PoC code to interact with new message format
